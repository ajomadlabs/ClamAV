We are currently working on a suite of products named Cleverhackers, Cleverhires, and Cleverschools.
Cleverhackers is a developer platform where developers can post interesting engineering problems or solve problems by other developers. If a developer finds a particular question interesting, they can buy a cup of coffee for the curator of that question.
Cleverhires is a set of tools like Video chat with a collaborative IDE, Sourcing through Cleverhackers, Automated Challenges for different job roles and a Question Library for technical hiring. It can help companies precisely fil in job roles by providing a complete analysis of the candidate and their solution.
Cleverschools helps to prepare the next generation of kids for technology first era. Teachers will be able to assist students to take their first steps in coding. They can curate fun and interesting programming puzzles that create enthusiasm among students. From the analysis we provide, teachers can help the students improve their ability. In countries like India, the disconnect between the tech industry and the education system is large, a tool like Cleverschools can reduce this gap.
